This is a chat-cum mail sending application trying to prototype maximum features of ymail and facebook. It allows the user to send and receive mails as well as to send chat lines messages.

This application was created  by me during winter @ CSE IIT KANPUR. It consists of a novel combination of ajax,javascript and several jquery algorithms like datepicker,ajax dropdown selecter, pquery,facebox,stylish alert box,etc. Basically I have tried to prototype the features available in ymail and facaebook. Mail saving feature is also implemented which saves the mail periodically at every 5 seconds interval using periodic ajax calls. It consists of several modes. It is basically an open source app.
